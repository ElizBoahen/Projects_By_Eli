Hi!

This is my log for my portfolio.

* Today I made a deleted a repository. Hopefully this repository won't reroute to the .md file.
* Currently, when I go to my site I see a 404 message.
* I'm so excited! The GitHub site is up!! Now I need to see if I can connect it to my domain. This is really a stretch goal but I want to see if this can work before I start working on the site. I also want to note that these logs will usually be a summary of that day's work, but I really want to document all the changes I made on the first day of my portfolio!!
* It's existing. It's kind of hard to believe. After so much searching and trying, I have a website.

Hi there!

I didn't push my changes from yesterday so I've set a reminder to push all my changes by 10:00pm today. I know that waiting until the site is "perfect" can be tempting, but having my website exist and safely backed-up is more important.

Another Day!

My goal today is to finish the Drawings page and add my plant-shelf to the site. I feel like the site will be ready to add to LinkedIn once I do that. From there, I need to make and design the Self-Introduction page. I still can't believe this is real really real thing.

The design page was much longer than I expected. Once I started writing about the process of building the plant shelf, I realized how much work I put into the project. I didn't expect to fill an entire page.


Next Steps:
- Fix Catalog page
- Test all menu options
- Short Bio for Self-Introduction 

Tomorrow is Sunday so I want give myself small goals
