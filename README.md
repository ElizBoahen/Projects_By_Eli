Hi!

This is my log for my portfolio.

* Today I made a deleted a repository. Hopefully this repository won't reroute to the .md file.
* Currently, when I go to my site I see a 404 message.
* I'm so excited! The GitHub site is up!! Now I need to see if I can connect it to my domain. This is really a stretch goal but I want to see if this can work before I start working on the site. I also want to note that these logs will usually be a summary of that day's work, but I really want to document all the changes I made on the first day of my portfolio!!
* It's existing. It's kind of hard to believe. After so much searching and trying, I have a website.

Hi there!

I didn't push my changes from yesterday so I've set a reminder to push all my changes by 10:00pm today. I know that waiting until the site is "perfect" can be tempting, but having my website exist and safely backed-up is more important.

Another Day!

My goal today is to finish the Drawings page and add my plant-shelf to the site. I feel like the site will be ready to add to LinkedIn once I do that. From there, I need to make and design the Self-Introduction page. I still can't believe this is real really real thing.

The design page was much longer than I expected. Once I started writing about the process of building the plant shelf, I realized how much work I put into the project. I didn't expect to fill an entire page.


Next Steps:
- Fix Catalog page
- Test all menu options
- Short Bio for Self-Introduction 

Tomorrow is Sunday so I want give myself small goals

Hi again!

This morning I added a picture to the Photography page and added a watermark. I still need to navigate Copyright and how to protect my images. The watermark really takes away from my pictures :/

I adjusted the Design page too. It was a challenge because:
 - Original margins: on desktop the pages look a bit narrow, on a tablet it looks great, on a phone it looks great
 - Push information to the edge: On desktop it looks great, on tablet it looks a bit better but still great, on a phone it looks too wide and almost touches the edges of the screen
In the end, I widened my content just a bit ore than the original format. This also led my to reformat the page ( changing how text and images were anchored, how paragraphs were spaced, etc. ).

Next Steps:
- Create self-intro video
- Figure out how to copyright my images
- Add 1 photography project / Add Animation section

Good morning!

I realized that the landing page doesn't really give any cues to the user, so today I'm going to add a pop-up the will direct the user to the navbar. This will suffice until can built out the rest of the site.

Ideally, I'd have
- A Landing page with pictures
- A gallery for reach section where clicking on the picture takes the user to a description of the project
- A back to top button on each descriptor page
- Connect my Medium page
I'm going to expand on this today. I think my site is at the "Good enough" stage, so now I can dream big and build off of that foundation.

Next Steps:
- Create self-intro video
- Ideate ideal world portfolio site
- Add video section

Early day and afternoon,

Stepping away from Oswald for bit proved to be really helpful. I noticed full blow grammar mistakes I've made and, thanks to feedback, can see what ways I can improve the navigation. 

Next Steps:
- Create self-intro video
- Link to HAWT Video Projects
- Add more photos

It's a very humid afternoon,

I saw a job opening and decided to add some sketches. I thought of one character attribute and ran, creating the 2 characters I'm adding today. This also means I should sort my drawings so the page flows better. I'm shelfing the video for now and moving forward with things that more directly help my portfolio.

I'm really happy that I have this :)

Next Steps:
- Create pages / sections for each drawing
- Add Character sketches
- Add more photos

I made edits yesterday but I don't think I updated my log. Today I made sure the links worked and I added sections to my bio to show that I'm actively seeking employment.
- Add 1 Photography project

I had an internship for 2 months. It became my priority

But I think I've been scared to update my portfolio. I got out of the groove of updating it and now the nervousness I had in the beginning has set in. I've gotten a chance--emphasis on "chance"--to talk to cool people and possibly do cool things. It's incredibly scary. Why am I writing this here? Well, this is my log. I put my progress, my ideas, and goals for my portfolio. On the off chance someone reads this: Hi, it's 12.56am and I'm typing this update message. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'll never know until I try.
- Log Update 1


I worked. It worked. It was just a few updates, but I made them. I hyperlinked some images in my sketch book, added a dash of spice to the landing page, and updated my "About Me" status. I want to do more but I'll stop for now. At least this is a goo sign that I'm exited to do more :)
