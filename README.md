Hi!

This is my log for my portfolio.

* Today I made a deleted a repository. Hopefully this repository won't reroute to the .md file.
* Currently, when I go to my site I see a 404 message.
* I'm so excited! The GitHub site is up!! Now I need to see if I can connect it to my domain. This is really a stretch goal but I want to see if this can work before I start working on the site. I also want to note that these logs will usually be a summary of that day's work, but I really want to document all the changes I made on the first day of my portfolio!!
