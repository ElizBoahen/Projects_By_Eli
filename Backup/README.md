Hi!

This is my log for my portfolio.

* Today I made a deleted a repository. Hopefully this repository won't reroute to the .md file.
* Currently, when I go to my site I see a 404 message.
* I'm so excited! The GitHub site is up!! Now I need to see if I can connect it to my domain. This is really a stretch goal but I want to see if this can work before I start working on the site. I also want to note that these logs will usually be a summary of that day's work, but I really want to document all the changes I made on the first day of my portfolio!!
* It's existing. It's kind of hard to believe. After so much searching and trying, I have a website.

Hi there!

I didn't push my changes from yesterday so I've set a reminder to push all my changes by 10:00pm today. I know that waiting until the site is "perfect" can be tempting, but having my website exist and safely backed-up is more important.

Another Day!

My goal today is to finish the Drawings page and add my plant-shelf to the site. I feel like the site will be ready to add to LinkedIn once I do that. From there, I need to make and design the Self-Introduction page. I still can't believe this is real really real thing.

The design page was much longer than I expected. Once I started writing about the process of building the plant shelf, I realized how much work I put into the project. I didn't expect to fill an entire page.


Next Steps:
- Fix Catalog page
- Test all menu options
- Short Bio for Self-Introduction 

Tomorrow is Sunday so I want give myself small goals

Hi again!

This morning I added a picture to the Photography page and added a watermark. I still need to navigate Copyright and how to protect my images. The watermark really takes away from my pictures :/

I adjusted the Design page too. It was a challenge because:
 - Original margins: on desktop the pages look a bit narrow, on a tablet it looks great, on a phone it looks great
 - Push information to the edge: On desktop it looks great, on tablet it looks a bit better but still great, on a phone it looks too wide and almost touches the edges of the screen
In the end, I widened my content just a bit ore than the original format. This also led my to reformat the page ( changing how text and images were anchored, how paragraphs were spaced, etc. ).

Next Steps:
- Create self-intro video
- Figure out how to copyright my images
- Add 1 photography project / Add Animation section

Good morning!

I realized that the landing page doesn't really give any cues to the user, so today I'm going to add a pop-up the will direct the user to the navbar. This will suffice until can built out the rest of the site.

Ideally, I'd have
- A Landing page with pictures
- A gallery for reach section where clicking on the picture takes the user to a description of the project
- A back to top button on each descriptor page
- Connect my Medium page
I'm going to expand on this today. I think my site is at the "Good enough" stage, so now I can dream big and build off of that foundation.

Next Steps:
- Create self-intro video
- Ideate ideal world portfolio site
- Add video section

Early day and afternoon,

Stepping away from Oswald for bit proved to be really helpful. I noticed full blow grammar mistakes I've made and, thanks to feedback, can see what ways I can improve the navigation. 

Next Steps:
- Create self-intro video
- Link to HAWT Video Projects
- Add more photos

# June 28th 2020

It's a very humid afternoon,

I saw a job opening and decided to add some sketches. I thought of one character attribute and ran, creating the 2 characters I'm adding today. This also means I should sort my drawings so the page flows better. I'm shelfing the video for now and moving forward with things that more directly help my portfolio.

I'm really happy that I have this :)

Next Steps:
- Create pages / sections for each drawing
- Add Character sketches
- Add more photos

# June 30th 2020

I made edits yesterday but I don't think I updated my log. Today I made sure the links worked and I added sections to my bio to show that I'm actively seeking employment.
- Add 1 Photography project

# September 4th 2020

I had an internship for 2 months. It became my priority

But I think I've been scared to update my portfolio. I got out of the groove of updating it and now the nervousness I had in the beginning has set in. I've gotten a chance--emphasis on "chance"--to talk to cool people and possibly do cool things. It's incredibly scary. Why am I writing this here? Well, this is my log. I put my progress, my ideas, and goals for my portfolio. On the off chance someone reads this: Hi, it's 12.56am and I'm typing this update message. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'll never know until I try.
- Log Update 1


I worked. It worked. It was just a few updates, but I made them. I hyper-linked some images in my sketch book, added a dash of spice to the landing page, and updated my "About Me" status. I want to do more but I'll stop for now. At least this is a goo sign that I'm exited to do more :)
- Log Update 2

Note, Don't push after 1am. There will be spelling errors in your commit messages . . .
That's it for the morning. I may stop by later tonight. If not tomorrow morning again :)

# September 13th 2020

==========================


# September 15th 2020

I thought I was going to bed but I decided not to.
- Log Update 1

I manage to create a gif of Project Oswald and I added it to the landing page. I realized just how litter color there is to my site; which is what I had intended but I don't know i that's really me or what I feel like I need to express to the artistic / creative world. Point being: The gif helped me scape-goat pushing a 1080p video to GitHub so yeah, good move.
- Log Update 2

I think that's enough for now. I added Proj Osw gifs to the Proj Osw page and changed some words to Courier New.
- Log Update 3

==========================


# August 27th 2021

I realized, after my commit messages started getting progressively longer, that I haven't updated my log!

The past few days have been a redesign of the site. The same light theme except with bolder lines and playful colors sprinkled throughout. There are a lot more animations and pretty much every picture has a drop shadow.

Overall, I wanted to make the site fee less cluttered.
I drafted this change on some index cards. The Homepage was going to have a completely different design:

A cartoon drawing of myself and either drawings or icons for each of my skills ( ex: Computer screens for front-end dev, VR headset for VR work, etc. ) This way allowing visitors to click on an area and I show at least one project showcasing my knowledge and capabilities.

That all changed when I moved all the homepage content except for the tagline; that's when I realized that my website needed space (and to be decluttered).

An addition form the planning stage that made it to the site is the Recruiter Page.
I've heard about the limited time used on applicants, so I made a page dedicated to answering the question Recruiters and Hiring Managers may have.

Super proud of where this is going
